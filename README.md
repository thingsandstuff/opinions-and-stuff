opinions-and-stuff
==================

Do you care about other people's opinions? No? Ask them anyways by creating a poll.

tech used
==================
based on random order in my head:
php
html
css
javascript
mysql

theoretical, barebones, pseudo design
==================
so there will be like a main page where you set the question and available answers.
after you submit the question you will get a url that will point to a generated page
with your question and your possible answers.
you can share the link with others so that they can go to it and choose one of the answers.
on the side of the page you will see statistics about how many people picked which answers.

ETA
=================
some day.
